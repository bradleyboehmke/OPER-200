## Introduction

The famous (Fisher's or Anderson's) `iris` data set contains `r nrow(iris)` observations of iris flowers and includes the following variables:

- sepal length
- sepal width
- petal length
- petal width
- species


## Descriptive Statistics
The average sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width across all observations are **`r round(apply(iris[, 1:4], MARGIN = 2, mean), 1)`** respectively. Additional descriptive statistics are detailed below:

```{r}
library(printr)

summary(iris)
```



## Illustration

The following graphic illustrates the relationship between sepal length and petal length categorized by Iris species.

```{r, fig.align='center'}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(iris, aes(Sepal.Length, Petal.Length, color = Species)) +
        geom_point()
```
